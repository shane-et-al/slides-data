#### Application Programming Interfaces 

Web scraping is most useful for when a site operator hasn't explicitly intended or imagined that you'd want to get or use data in a certain way. Brandon, writing all his blog posts, probably didn't think of us downloading them and perhaps running some fancy text analysis on them. Nor NUFORC.

But sometimes, people actually want us to use their data. Occasionally, they've put in a lot of work to give us access to the data we specifically want in the formats that's most useful to conveying pure information. Most of the times, though, they want to sell that access to us.

The typical way to do this is the API. Where the rest of the Web is primarily intended for humans, APIs are a part of the web that's mostly intended for computers to talk to other computers.

I wrote a real [quick and dirty demo](https://github.com/shane-et-al/petfinder-test/blob/master/pf-img.py) that uses the Petfinder API.
