Of course, sometimes even better than an API is when someone has anticipated your exact need and just put everything together in a big file you can download. Here's where having a good sense of different data formats is helpful!

- [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)
