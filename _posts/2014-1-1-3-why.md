<aside markdown="1" class="notes">
1. Lots of useful information is on the Internet and not all of it is readily accessible through the Web
2. Research takes a long time and the Web is constantly changing. Saving a copy yourself lets you preserve information for when you need it down the road and to let others replicate and build on your research.
3. Some of it is Big, too big to tease apart manually. Having your own copy lets you work on it with tools designed to process big data.
4. Some of it is shackled to how a site or service operator thinks that you should or could use it. Scraping the data means you can use it how you want.
5. Even if you don't want to do some fancy pants analysis on the data, having a local copy is a good way to simply organize your research in one place, do basic text searches.
