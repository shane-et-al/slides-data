## HyperText Markup Language

- Language of the Web
- Very verbose
- More free-flowing structure and intended, primarily, to be read by humans
- Often written by humans who make a horrible mess of things
- Related to languages like XML

Looks like this (snippet):
<pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
<main role="main" id="main">
<p>Here are some of the Scholars' Lab pets:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Shane's dog Rocky, who is a Texas Heeler.</li>
    <li>Amanda's dog Maple, who is a hound.</li>
    <li>Jeremy's cat Punky, who is an absolute terror.</li>
</ul>
</code></pre>

How does this compare to CSV and JSON?

Definition: Markup language: a way to stiffen up text by providing some structure and formatting, but short of formats more intended to be consumed by computers.

HTML can have lists, as we see here, and tabular data. And, as a format that often centers text, we can just use language to describe the relationship between different elements.

But it's almost always harder to parse the underlying information.
