title: "Data types"
---

In computer science, we describe a particular expression of data, which guides how computers and humans intepret it and places constraints on its representation, as its "data type"

Examples (non-comprehensive):
- Text
- Numbers (integers, reals, etc)
- Boolean

<aside markdown="1" class="notes">
Here, representation is tricky: as humans, we use text to represent all kinds of different kinds of data. We can write out "2+5" as text and have it make sense as integer addition because it conforms to those particular constraints. We can just as easily write out "2+cat" as text and not have it make sense in the same way.
