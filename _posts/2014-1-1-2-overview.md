## What this talk is about

This is not really a talk about Web scraping, this is a talk about getting data from the Internet.

We'll talk about:

- What is data?
- What kinds of data are there?
- Why do we want to get the data?
- How do we get data from the Internet?
- What kind of data is easy to get and what kind is hard?

## What this talk is not about

We only have a short time today, so a lot of this will be more of a demo than a tutorial.

<aside markdown="1" class="notes">
Web scraping is a technical method that covers a specific way to get data from the Web, but most people probably don't think of it 
What is data and kinds of data: how do we think of data? How is data organized? What are some common data formats?

How: cover a variety of different techniques (download existing datasets, wget, webrecorder tools, web scraping, API calls)
Easy/hard: helps guide what are possible/plausible sources and which technique is appropriate for which

We'll focus on how to think about data and understanding what's possible through different techniques. That way, you can look out for data that will be useful for you and know what kind of things you should investigate further and come to us for help on.
