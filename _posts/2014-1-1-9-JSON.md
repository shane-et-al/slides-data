## JavaScript Object Notation

- Represents an object in Javascript
- Easy to bring into and out of programming languages like Javascript and Python
- Can represent complex, nested structures

Looks like this:
<pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
[
  {
    "name": "Rocky",
    "owner": "Shane",
    "type": ["Australian Cattledog","Australian Shepherd"]
    "likes": [
      "vocalizing",
      "cats"
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "Maple",
    "owner": "Amanda",
    "type": "Hound",
    "likes": [
      "zoomies",
      "looking"
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "Hopper",
    "owner": "Jeremy",
    "type": "Short-hair housecat",
    "dislikes": [
      "Getting chased",
      "Having a dog all up in his space",
      "Objects near ledges"
    ]
  }
]
</code></pre>
