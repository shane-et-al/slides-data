title: "A note about WARC"
---

Wget downloaded all the files, but a bunch of files aren't exactly a website.

Part of our Wget command included the flag `--warc-file=walshbr` and we can see that we have an extra file called walshbr.wacz.gz. This is a Web Archive file.

We can load the WARC file format (and the related WACZ format) into a WARC player, such as at [replayweb.page](https://replayweb.page/), a project of our friendly acquaintances at WebRecorder. 

<aside markdown="1" class="notes">
`pip install wacz`
And then `wacz create -f walshbr.warc.gz -o walshbr.wacz --detect-pages --text`

WARC was created by the Internet Archive to store its own web crawl and is the Library of Congress's preferred Web Archive storage format.
