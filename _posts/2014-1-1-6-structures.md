Data structures define relationships between datum.

Common data structures (non-comprehensive):
- Sets
- Lists
- Matrices/Tables
- Mappings/Dictionaries
- Trees

We can combine different structures into more complicated forms.

A data type describes one piece of data. A datum, if you will. Multiple pieces of data can then be organized in different ways that express different relationships between each other, which we describe as "structures".

Complex data structure: a dictionary for a natural language will typically define a mapping (a data structure) between a word (which is text) and a list (another data structure) of definitions (texts again).
