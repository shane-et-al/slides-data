If you don't know what a terminal command does, there's a [nice website that tries to explains each little part](https://explainshell.com/explain?cmd=wget+%5C+++++--mirror+%5C+++++--warc-file%3Dboggs+%5C+++++--page-requisites+%5C+++++--adjust-extension+%5C+++++--convert-links+%5C+++++--execute+robots%3Doff+%5C+++++--directory-prefix%3D.+%5C+++++--span-hosts+%5C+++++--user-agent%3DMozilla+%5C+++++--timeout%3D60+%5C+++++--dns-timeout%3D15+%5C+++++--connect-timeout%3D15+%5C+++++--domains%3Dwalshbr.com+%5C+++++https%3A%2F%2Fwalshbr.com%2F).
